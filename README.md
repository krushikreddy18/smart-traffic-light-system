# SIP Smart Traffic Light System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic Light System** is designed to manage traffic efficiently across three intersections using real-time vehicle detection. This system leverages **infrared (IR) sensors** to detect vehicle presence, dynamically adjusting traffic light priorities based on traffic volume at each intersection. The goal is to minimize traffic congestion and improve traffic flow.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Uses IR sensors to detect vehicles.
- **Dynamic Traffic Light Adjustment**: Traffic light timings are adjusted based on vehicle counts at each intersection.
- **Efficient Traffic Flow**: Reduces congestion by assigning traffic light priority according to real-time traffic conditions.

## Components

1. **Infrared (IR) Sensors**: Used to detect vehicle presence at intersections.
2. **Traffic Light Module**: Consists of red, yellow, and green LEDs, controlled dynamically to manage traffic.
3. **Microcontroller**: Manages input from sensors and controls traffic light operations.
4. **Power Supply**: Powers the system components.

## Working Principle

1. **Infrared Sensors (IR)**: These sensors detect vehicles at each intersection by emitting and receiving infrared radiation.
2. **Traffic Light Module**: The traffic lights (red, yellow, and green LEDs) are controlled to adjust traffic flow based on vehicle detection.
3. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment**: Based on the vehicle count at each intersection, the system dynamically changes the light duration to prioritize congested lanes.
